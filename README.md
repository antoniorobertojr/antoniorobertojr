# Hello, 👋 I'm Antonio Roberto

## 🚀 About Me
I discovered my passion for programming when I built my first bot to scrape soccer match odds. Initially, my projects were centered around automation of daily tasks, web scraping and machine learning, with a focus on predicting match outcomes. With time, my focus shifted towards cloud development and backend technologies, where I found a new passion in deploying applications on AWS and creating robust backend systems with FastAPI and Django.

## 💻 What I'm Focused On
I'm currently seeking opportunities in backend/cloud development, where I can leverage my Python and AWS skills. I'm eager to join a team where I can both contribute my expertise and grow from feedback provided by seasoned developers.
